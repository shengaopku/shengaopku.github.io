Hi! I am a Ph.D student at Peking University working on Natural Language Processing Research. I am currently based in Beijing, China. Before joining  Peking University, I earned my Master Degree from Beijing Institute of Technology, China in 2018. During my PhD, I worked on text summarization, dialog system and text generation.
